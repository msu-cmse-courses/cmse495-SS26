# Common Feedback from previous proposals

- Use existing libraries/tools and don't reinvent the wheel.
- Try to minimize number of languages.  If this means avoiding python for another consider it.
- Focus on end-to-end workflows.  Stub the code and then iterate to get better.  Don't plan to finish one part and move on.
- Data/model need not be perfect first iteration. Start with the simple model and write the code so that it can be easily updated and improved. Use early results to provide a benchmarks to measure improvement.
- Plan for problems by anticipating challenges.  Whenever possible do not wait for the last minute.
- Put in self evaluation checks to make sure everyone has the support they need to contribute to the team.
