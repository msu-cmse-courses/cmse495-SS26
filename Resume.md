## How to Showcase Your CMSE 495 Data Science Capstone on Your Resume

The CMSE 495 Data Science Capstone is more than a class: it’s a hands-on project that demonstrates your ability to apply data science skills to real-world problems. Employers value this experience because it shows you can analyze data, collaborate effectively, and deliver actionable insights. Here’s how to make it stand out.

### Where Should It Go?
Your CMSE 495 project can appear in multiple places on your resume, including:

- **Projects Section** – Ideal for technical roles; include the project title, a short description, and measurable outcomes.
- **Education Section** – Under “Data Science Capstone” or “Relevant Coursework.”
- **Experience Section** – If your work resembled professional responsibilities, such as presenting results or managing deliverables.

### How to Describe It:
Focus on impact and clarity. Use strong action verbs and quantify results whenever possible. Instead of saying ***“Worked on a data analysis project,”*** write ***““Developed predictive models that improved forecast accuracy by 15%.”*** Mention tools and technologies such as Python, R, SQL, machine learning libraries and keep it concise.

Here are a few quick tips:
- Highlight your role and contributions (e.g., data cleaning, model development, visualization).
- Mention key deliverables (dashboard, report, presentation).
- Note collaboration with **Community Partners**.
- Add a link to your GitHub or portfolio if allowed.

### Example:
> **CMSE 495 Data Science Capstone: Predictive Analytics for Retail**  
> Built a machine learning model predicting sales with 85% accuracy using Python and scikit-learn. Delivered insights to Community Partners, influencing inventory strategy.
