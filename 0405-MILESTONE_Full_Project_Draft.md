# Project Draft

![Image of a team gathered around a computer generated by Microsoft Copliot with the prompt "I have a capstone class assignment for http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse495 which is a "full project draft". The assignment website needs a motivating graphic. Can you help me generate an image?"](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7-zMdzHY81IX91HgRKC5oNFQnCvzq6HSC8UVENEYRxRLXIfx9U-Tzs_AV-Sh6zf1jb3eX7vPtZLTl8fOzeKaK2HkU64sLMK6Nw0CAzPw3Aejjb29Au0iw9u4ZdI7qdZn1532gWWiVBk=w740)

In this assignment you will clean finish up the git structure to make it as easy as possible for others to use.  Since we are past our MVP presentation it is reasonable to assume that you can provide everything needed for someone else to review your project.  We have been doing pieces of this all semester but here we will add a few finishing touches to make the project complete. Specifically we need to put in enough structure such that someone else taking the course can get it up and running. This includes:

1. Final Report outline and draft - This doesn't have to be complete but it also should have something written for all sections.
2. Installation Instructions
3. Testing/Demo Instructions
4. NDA approved Examples

You must review the instructor feedback from all of the previous assignments and make sure everything has been addressed. 

In class on Monday you will be paired up with another team. Have a plan for how you will share your instructions with your partner team. This includes providing them with access to data, a draft of your report and any instructions they need to get things up and running.  It is highly recommended that you practice your plan before class to ensure everything is ready and in place.

Please notify the instructor as soon as possible if you can not figure out a reasonable way to share without violating your NDA or IP agreements.  You can not use this as an excuse to not do the assignment.  The goal here is to provide feedback early enough that you can make changes.  This is a trial run for making robust and reproducible code.

# Submission

To get credit for this assignment, put a copy of your plan in your team's public folder so that you can share the plan with the rest of the class. 

Send a practice email to the instructors as if you were submitting your final project to your community partner.  The email should thank the community partner and include access to any attachments and/or links to git repositories folders so that the partners can easily figure out what you did and get it working on their own systems. Make you put the "PRACTICE" keyword in the email so that we know to provide feedback. 



## Evaluation

Your draft submission will be evaluated based on how well it demonstrates a near-complete version of your final project, with a strong emphasis on clarity, professionalism, and reproducibility. Instructors will review your plan, repository, report draft, and project functionality. Points will be deducted for missing, unclear, or incomplete components.

Make sure your instructions are easy to follow, your report is well-organized, and your code and results can be reproduced without confusion. This is your opportunity to show that your project is nearly ready to share with your community partner.

- **15 pts** – Clear, professional email with links or attachments and a thank-you to the community partner.
- **15 pts** – Well-organized and accessible Git repository with all necessary files and documentation.
- **30 pts** – Clear instructions and materials that allow others to reproduce your current results.
- **30 pts** – Well-written draft of the final report with all major sections.
- **10 pts** – Project is nearly complete and functional.
