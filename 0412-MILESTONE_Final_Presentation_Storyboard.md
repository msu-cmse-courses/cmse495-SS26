As a team you need to prepare for two final presentations.  The first will be your final video and the second will be an in-person presentation at the symposium.  This assignment you will present a plan for both.  There are two deliverables for this assignment:

1. Storyboard for your final video
2. Basic script for your final presentation.

# 1. Storyboarding

At this point in the semester I will assume that you know how to build a storyboard. Make one for your final presentation.  This is your big moment so make it look good. 

This presentation should focus on the final outcomes and conclusions of your project. Here are things you may want to include:

- Team name, title and members
- Description of the problem your team was charged to solve
- Your conclusions and results
- Demos
- Summary figures
- A thank you for the community partner

# 2. Presentation Plan

Your final presentation will be in the form of a in-person digital poster session.  You will be expected to stand in front of a display and talk about your project. These types of presentations are tricky as they will require you to be flexible.  

It is important that you give everyone on your team a role and maybe even switch it up a bit.  For example, you could have someone be the "main" presenter, someone else run the demo, a third person would be in charge of answering questions, etc. 

Key to a good interactive presentation is to keep your audience engaged. You will be presenting for a half hour so do NOT stop. If no one is around your presentation go out and invite people to ask questions.  Plan on giving the same presentation multiple times. 

Please type up a plan (and practice) your presentations. This can just be a simple text document you put in your pubic team folder. Some things to include:

- A short script or summary of what you plan to say.
- A list of roles for the team.
- What will your team wear?
- What questions do you anticipate and how will you answer them?

# Submission

Include a copy of the storyboard in your teams drive as a PowerPoint file. Give it a reasonable name so the instructor does not need to hunt for it. 

Put your plan and storyboard in your public team folder so they can be reviewed by your peer teams on Monday. The title of the file should make it clear what it is. Something like:

"**YYYYMMDD_Final_Presentation_Plan_**".
